# Retail Sales Analytics Dashboard (SQL + Tableau)

This project simulates a **retail sales analytics pipeline** using **PostgreSQL + Tableau**.  
I generated synthetic data for customers, products, and orders, then wrote SQL queries to analyze key business metrics.

## Key Insights
- Sales & profit trends over time
- Top 10 products by revenue
- Sales breakdown by region & customer segment
- Identification of high-value customers (top 5%)
- Churn analysis (inactive customers in last 6 months)

## Tech Stack
- PostgreSQL (Data Storage & Queries)
- SQL (Analysis)
- Tableau (Dashboards)
